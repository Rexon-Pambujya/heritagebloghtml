                <p>Located in the Panchmahal district, the Champaner-Pavagadh Archaeological Park is centred 
                upon the medieval city of Muhammadabad which was built by Sultan Mahmud Begada in the 16th century. 
                While the Park contains 11 different types of heritage monuments, the truly fascinating element here 
                is that a majority of Champaner-Pavagadh remains unexcavated. This is also the only completely unaltered 
                pre-Mughal city in India.</p>
                <p><b>Best Time to Visit:</b> October to February</p>
                <p><b>How to Get Here:</b> The nearest airport is Vadodara at a distance of 42 kms. Vadodara Railway Station at 48 kms is another option.</p>

                The Assam Government has made herculean efforts to preserve the range of flora and fauna here,
